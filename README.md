# Hello Backbone.js Tutorial
_Hello World examples of increasing complexity for [Backbone.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone)._

This tutorial is a collection of minimalistic, self-explanatory examples illustrating the use of Backbone.js. It was created to provide a smoother transition from zero to the infamous [Todo example](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html).

The example numbers are in order of increasing complexity. For clarity purposes, the Javascript code is always divided in three parts: `Classes`, `Objects`, and `Actions`. If a pattern or method call is not commented here, it is probably because it is already well-documented in the [Backbone.js documentation](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

Have fun!
